### GENERAL CONFIG ###

# unique identifier for metrics calculation experiment
exp_id: "deuce_rapsd_member_metric"
logging_level: INFO
# debugging flag, so that we don't try and go trough all the samples
# set to False or integer (num of samples to pick)
debugging: False
# If set to false, existing contingency tables will simply be used to compute metric values
accumulate: True
# number of chunks to divide the timestamps in for parallelization
# for NO parallelization set to 0
# otherwise set to a positive integer smalller than the number of test samples
# recommended is to set equal or bigger to the number of available processing units
n_chunks: 500
n_workers: 20
